# ember-document-merge-service
This addon contains Ember components that provide a UI for the 
[document-merge-service](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/document-merge-service/).

## Compatibility
* Ember.js v2.18 or above
* Ember CLI v2.13 or above

## Installation
```
ember install ember-document-merge-service
```

You will then have to configure Ember-Ajax in the consuming application.
```js
// app/services/ajax.js
import AjaxService from "ember-ajax/services/ajax";

export default AjaxService.extend({
  host: "http://localhost:8888",
  namespace: "/api/v1",
  contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8"
});
```

### Usage
The addon is divided into three components that can be included individually.

#### Upload
The upload component provides a form to select a file to upload and define a slug and label for the template. If the backend responds with an error, the message(s) will be added to the corresponding form elements.

#### Delete
The delete component provides a list with the existing templates. Each templates comes with a delete link and deletion is guarded by a confirmation dialog.

#### Merge
The merge component provides a dropdown to select from the existing templates which can then be merged with a data object.
